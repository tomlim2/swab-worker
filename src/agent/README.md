# Agent Test & Reference Files

This folder contains test files and reference implementations created during the refactoring process. These files are kept for reference and testing purposes but are not part of the main application.

## Files Overview

### Reference Implementations
- **`index_clean.ts`** - Complete working implementation with all code in a single file (943 lines)
  - This is the reference version that contains all functionality in one place
  - Useful for comparison and understanding the complete implementation
  - Contains class-based Supabase client implementation

### Test Files
- **`test-db.ts`** - Database module testing file
  - Used to test database module exports and functionality
  - Created during debugging of TypeScript import issues

### Experimental/Alternative Implementations
- **`index_new.ts`** - Alternative utils implementation
  - Experimental version of utility functions
  - Created during modular extraction process

### Separated Constants (for reference)
- **`config.ts`** - Configuration constants
- **`days.ts`** - Day mapping constants  
- **`html.ts`** - HTML dashboard template
- **`test.ts`** - Test-related constants

## Purpose

These files serve as:
1. **Reference implementations** for comparing with the modular version
2. **Test artifacts** created during the refactoring process
3. **Alternative approaches** that were considered but not used in final implementation
4. **Backup files** that preserve the complete working implementation

## Current Active Implementation

The main application uses the modular structure:
- `src/index.ts` - Main worker file (535 lines, 43% reduction from original)
- `src/constants/index.ts` - Consolidated constants
- `src/lib/` - Modular implementation (database, handlers, utils, slack)
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript type definitions

## Build Status

✅ **Main modular implementation**: Wrangler build passes (38.65 KiB bundle)
✅ **Reference implementation**: Complete and functional
